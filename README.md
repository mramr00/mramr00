Computer Science Student at the University of Tabriz | Aspiring AI & Cybersecurity
Specialist | Problem Solver

I am a 5th-semester Computer Science student with a passion for exploring what happens "under the hood" of technology. Whether it's building a Compiler from scratch or developing an Automation System for industrial projects like dorkar app, I thrive on turning complex logic into functional, efficient code.

My journey has allowed me to bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world application. I have successfully designed and deployed:

Corporate Web Platforms and personal blogs.

Python-based Automation and remote control systems (IoT).

Custom Telegram Bots to streamline user interaction.

Beyond coding, I have a keen eye for Graphic Design, allowing me to build products that are not only technically sound but also visually engaging.

Currently, I am deep-diving into the Core of Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence, aiming to build secure, intelligent systems that can withstand the challenges of tomorrow’s digital landscape.

I am always open to collaborating on innovative projects or discussing the latest in AI and InfoSec. Let’s connect and build something meaningful
